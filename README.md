# Proof-of-concept Quantum Use Cases

As part of the Q-Access initiative, DeiC’s Quantum Department is developing a series of proof-of-concept quantum use case to make applying quantum algorithms to real-world problems more accessible to Danish academia and industry.

In the current NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era, the most feasible and promising use cases for quantum computing are optimization, simulation, and machine learning. To tackle problems in these areas, most NISQ algorithms take a hybrid approach by using classical optimization techniques to tune the parameters of variational quantum circuits. 

For each proof-of-concept use case, we will consider some real-world problem and then walk through, step by step, a variational quantum algorithm which solves the problem. Each use case includes a full-length tutorial with background and motivation, a shorter overview with the key details, and an interactive Python notebook implementing the solution.
